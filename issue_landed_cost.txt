**Allows only one Vendor Bill in Landed Cost (needs Many2many)**

Impacted versions:
 
 - 17.0
 - 18.0
 - 19.0
 
Steps to reproduce:
 
 1. Go to Inventory → Operations → Landed Costs
 2. Create a new Landed Cost
 3. Try to assign multiple Vendor Bills
 4. Notice the field Vendor Bill is a Many2one, allowing only a single bill.

 
Current behavior:
 
 - Odoo only allows one vendor bill (vendor_bill_id - many2one) to be linked to a Landed Cost.
 - Many real-world landed cost operations involve multiple invoices such as:
	1. Freight Invoice
	2. Handling Charges Invoice
	3. Customs Invoice
	4. Transport Invoice
	5. Port Charges
 - Users cannot attach all related bills to one landed cost, causing:
	1. Incorrect audit trails
	2. Missing traceability
	3. Need to create multiple landed costs instead of one


 
Expected behavior:
 
 - Landed Cost should support linking multiple vendor bills, using a Many2many field instead of Many2one
 - This aligns with real business processes where multiple invoices contribute to the total landed cost of goods.
 - The user should be able to:
	1. Add multiple Vendor Bills
	2. View all related invoices from the Landed Cost form
	3. Keep cost distribution logic unchanged
